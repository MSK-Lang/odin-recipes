    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, 
        parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. 
        It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>
<li> <ol>
        Gather all ingredients
</ol>
    
<ol>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside</ol>
<ol>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</ol>
 <ol>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</ol>
<ol>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</ol>
<ol>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.
 </ol>
 <ol>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</ol>
<ol>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</ol>
<ol>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</ol>
<ol>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</ol>
<ol>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.
